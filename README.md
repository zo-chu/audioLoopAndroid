Kotlin audio loop

Proof of concept for real time audio proccessing in Kotlin 

Back in the day, there were no examples of how this can be done, the only option was to go and write a ton of Java code, yikes! 

With Kotlin gaining popularity it was interesting to see how audio proccessing on Android could be done without Java or C.
